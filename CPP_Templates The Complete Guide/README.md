This was an incredibly well designed book that covers many things about C++ templates. I learned a lot of things from this book, such as deducing a common return type, more information about forwarding, how to check if a type has a specific method, etc. But this is expected when one of your co-authors is Nicolai Josuttis, whom I've read other books written by. The authors do a good job of combining both breadth and width of details. It's just specific enough to where it can satisfy a pedants desire for intricate, while also giving enough information to the regular individual who just wants a basic understanding of what's happening. Something I was hoping for though, was more strategies on debugging template errors, as they're notorious for being huge and illegible. I also hope that some day there will be a third edition, which I would gladly buy. But yeah, I'll be keeping this book as a reference for if I ever get rusty on template usage. At the time I'm writing this, I'm mostly using C++17 since it's the most widely used C++ standard according to two JetBrains surveys. Once that changes to C++20 or C++23, I'll be following suit, in which I will most likely not be using it as a reference. But it is a very good read and very helpful book regardless.
