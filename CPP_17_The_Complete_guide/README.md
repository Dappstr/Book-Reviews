So this will be my review for "C++17 - The Complete Guide." I pretty much read the whole book front to back, with some skips because I have more "concentrated" material on some of the subjects, or I've already learned them. This was another excellent book by Nicolai Josuttis. Josuttis combines excellent explanations with easy to follow code examples. He is really talented at his craft of explaining things to mindful readers. I think anyone wanting to get an up-to-date refresher on C++17, or is completely new to learning C++ standards, should read this. It provides enough material without being too dense a book. I was able to finish it within a week. There is an incredible amount of information compacted into about 350 pages of writing. I was particularly interested in C++17 because it is the most commonly used standards according to two JetBrains surveys, one in 2022 (source: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/cpp/) and one in 2023 (source: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/cpp/). This book gave me an excellent refresher on using structured bindings, deduction guides, introduced me to std::any and std::filesystem, and much more. Again, I would highly recommend anyone wanting to get an introduction into C++17 to read this book.
