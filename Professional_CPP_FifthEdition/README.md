This was by far the biggest/thickest programming book I've ever read. It is packed so full with so much useful information, I am surprised it does not cost more. I decided not to get the even more recent one containing C++23 features as I'm still moreso using C++17 for my projects since it's the most widely used standard by people according to two JetBrains surveys. But anyway, I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to level up their C++ skills. I skimmed some chapters as I already knew intimately what the subject/topic was for the chapter. However, I still tried to learn at least something new in each chapter I read, and I largely succeeded. I also skipped the professional software development section as right now I'm not employed as a professional programmer (though I do hope to one day be one), but I will come back to it once I have interviews and job offers lined up. The templates and multithreading sections are also something I skimmed, as I have a much more dedicated source on C++ templates, as well as a whole book and course dedicated to multithreading that will cover things in more detail. But still, this is a very wonderful and insightful book for both hobby and professional C++ programmers.
